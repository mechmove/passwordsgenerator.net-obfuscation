The inspiration for this program are the Codility tests I have been taking. This small program is to "scramble" passwords are that available from web sites to ensure you are most likely the only one with that password. You should change the input "s" in Shuffle(int cuts, string s) to something unique.

Disclaimer, I am a frequent user of "passwordsgenerator.net", but I have no association.
